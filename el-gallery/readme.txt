EL-Gallery is an elegant untra-lightweight javascript & css gallery replacement for Wordpress.


== Description ==

[EL-Gallery](http://ericlowry.fr/en/development/#el-gallery "EL-Gallery, the lightweight wordpress gallery") will simply adapt to your website’s width without any fuss or hours of configuration.

A few simple options are at your disposal if you wish, but the plugin will work perfectly well as soon as it is installed.

= Details =
I am not a professional developer, but there were no plugins that were both simple enough and could adapt to responsive design. This is why I chose to code this plugin.

EL-Gallery should function properly on any browser that supports both CSS3 and javascript.

If you have any suggestions or questions, please [contact me](http://ericlowry.fr/en/contact/ "Contact Eric Lowry (Plugin Author)") directly, or propose changes on [this project's GitHub page](https://github.com/ELowry/EL-Gallery "EL-Gallery on GitHub").

This plugin is designed to function on any type of machine, and for it to best function on mobile devices, we reccomend you install the [WP Mobile Detect](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mobile-detect/ "Plugin : WP Mobile Detect") plugin.

EL-Gallery is currently available in both English and French. If you wish to help translate it into another language, please [contact me](http://ericlowry.fr/en/contact/ "Contact Eric Lowry (Plugin Author)").

= Configuration =
Once installed, you will find the configuration menu for EL-Gallery in the “Appearance” section of  your wordpress administration page.

There you will be able to modify the duration of each slide as well as a few other functions:

* EL-Gallery uses responsive design, and you may wish to choose a specific page width at which the thumbnails will go from 8 per line to 5 per line.
* You may wish to disable the links on a gallery’s images.
* If you have installed the [WP Mobile Detect](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mobile-detect/ "Plugin : WP Mobile Detect") plugin, don’t forget to activate the corresponding option so images may display in a lighter format when on mobile devices.
* You can use the following [shortcode parameters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API#Overview "About Shortcode Attributes"):
  * _nopause="1"_ to remove the pause button and autoplay functionality
  * _nothumb="1"_ to remove the thumbnail display.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin.
2. Simply go under the the *Plugins* menu in WordPress, then click on Add new and select the plugin's .zip file
3. Alternatively you can upload the *el-gallery* folder to the */wp-content/plugins/* directory.
4. Finally, activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Your gallery shortcodes will automatically be updated to EL-Galleries !

Note : If your theme or other plugins cause incompatibility issues (mainly overriding EL-Gallery), simply change any [gallery] shortcode to [el-gallery].
